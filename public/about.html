<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Dewi, someone who loves learning and creating cool things. Whether it’s baking delicious cakes, arranging pretty flower bouquets, or figuring out how to build websites, I enjoy bringing ideas to life. I’ve also spent time teaching English to beginners, making learning simple and fun. Right now, I’m exploring the world of coding—starting with HTML—and seeing where it takes me! </p>

<p>When I’m not busy with that, you’ll probably find me trying out new recipes, geeking out over tech, or just enjoying a good conversation. I believe in doing what makes me happy, even if it means taking a few unexpected turns along the way. This website is just the start, and I can’t wait to see what comes next!</p>
